## Physics 0???, University of Pittsburgh *(Fall 2017)*
## Syllabus

### Course Information

Meeting Time: 1 hour/week.  Ideally at lunchtime with provided pizza.

### Instructor Information
Michael Wood-Vasey, wmwv@pitt.edu
Allen Hall 308

### Course Description and Objectives:
Introduce first-year students to the field, practice, research, and opportunities in Physics and Astronomy.  Students will be able to describe the variety of pursuits that physicists pursue; explain both the basic and recent topics in Physics and Astronomy to the lay-person; understand their own career interests and potential pursuit of Physics, Astronomy, and related disciplines.  This is intended to be taken for a satisfactory/non-satisfactory grade.

### Prerequisites:  None

### Organization of Course Content:
In-class time will focus on discussions, interactive exercises, and quick presentations.  Out-of-class time will be spent reading material and reflecting on questions about physics and astronomy and the students' plans for the future.

### Course requirements: weekly reading, in-class and out-of-class short writing assignments, in-class presentations.

### Hours/week: 3

### Weekly assignments:
Out-of-class activities will include readings and short writing assignments.
